## 2025-07-01 (v1.4.0-rc1)

- Change API to TypeSpec as source of truth.
- Change generated libraries to `openapi-generator` version 7 with modified templates (see `templates` directory).
    - PHP
        - Minimal changes in the use of the library.
    - Python
        - Imports have changes, all models and apis are in separate modules and some have moved for example `api.model` -> `api.models` and `api.apis` -> `api.api`.
        - Model members are now `snake_case`.
        - Enums are now derived from `enum.Enum`.
        - `JsonPatchDocument` has been replaced with `list[Operation]`.
        - Files are now returned as plain `bytearray`.
    - C#
        - New library is generic host based, so `Configuration` class has been removed and more. See the new example on how to use the client with tokens.
        - Uses `System.Text.Json` for JSON processing
        - `JsonPatchDocument`, `Operation` and `OperationType` were dropped and now use the models from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch`
        - `ValidationProblemDetails` and `ProblemDetails` were dropped and now use the models from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`
        - Sync versions of operations been removed, added Events based alternative

## 2024-05-14 (v1.3.1)

- Add `DeelWaarderingWebhookPayload` model.
- Use of strings for CBS codes.
    - Add `buurtCode` field to `CbsIndeling` model.
    - Allow for string input for endpoint `buurt`.

## 2023-11-14 (v1.3.0)

- Add `geldverstrekker` field to the `CallbackInschrijving` model.
- Add support for mTLS on the callback service.
    - By default when requested by the target server the public CA signed TLS certificate with the appropriate domain as Common Name will be offered as the client certificate.
    - Public TLS Certificates rotate every couple of months.
- Change a couple of `date-time` fields that only contained a date to pure `date` fields. This might result is a different type in the generated clients and the service-side validation will be more strict. Times included in values will no longer be silently dropped, but will generate an error.
    - Change `Modeldata` model `waardebepalingsdatum` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec.
    - Change `Bestemmingsdata` model `datumBestemmingplan` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec.
    - Change `Bodemdata` model `datumLaatsteOnderzoek` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec.
    - Change `Referentieobject` model `verkoopdatum` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec.
    - Change `VorigeVerkoop` model `verkoopdatum` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec.
    - Change `waarderingInputParameters` model `peildatum` field to type `date` in OpenAPI spec. This is an input field and will now require a date without a time.
- Add `desktopTaxatieHerwaardering` product to enumeration `ProductType`.
- The service no longer returns CORS headers.
- Actions now correctly report the 'application/problem+json' Content-Type in the documentation for the `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` responses.
- Added `energielabelData` field to `Objectdata` model to contain the extra information about the energy label.
- The OpenAPI spec generation was changed slightly and thus the generated and published clients might be affected. There might be some slight breaking changes at compile time, but the functionality remains the same.
    - For example for C# and PHP `AdresInfoAdres` is now just covered by `Adres`
    - Likewise for the `Omgevingsdata*` models that are now all covered by `Gebiedsdata`
    - For a lot of the `Waardering*` models they are now using the correct model names, like `WaarderingModel` -> `Modeldata`
